Next Release
------------

- Removed unnecessary 'dummyengine' dependency on zope.i18n to
  simplify distribution.

- Supprort ability to run tests using "setup.py test".

- Stop pinning (no longer required) zope.traversing and
  zope.app.publisher versions in buildout.cfg.

3.4.0 (2007-10-03)
------------------

- Updated package meta-data.


3.4.0b1
-------

- Updated dependency for ``zope.i18n`` that requires the correct version of
  zope.security to avoid a hidden dependency issue in zope.security.

Note: The code changes before 3.4.0b1 where not tracked as an individual
package and have been documented in the Zope 3 changelog.
